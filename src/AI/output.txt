Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) is less than pleased about President Donald Trump firing Gen. Timothy Haugh, who headed both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command until Thursday — when he was let go without a single reason divulged to voters. “The White House fired one of our best generals and the smartest on cyber operations, and with no explanation,” Bacon told Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram on Friday. “Russia and China are laughing at us.”

Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday to CBS News that the “Defense Department thanks General Timothy Haugh for his decades of service” and that the DoD wishes “him and his family well” — providing no further detail about his exit. Several senior members of the National Security Council were also fired. Haugh and NSA deputy Wendy Noble were both ousted after Trump met with far-right activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported. Loomer, who has frequently shared QAnon conspiracy theories and is one of Trump’s staunchest social media supporters, told the Post she had advocated for the firings.

Loomer elaborated on the matter Friday on X, formerly Twitter, arguing that Haugh and Noble “have been disloyal to President Trump” and “that is why they have been fired.” She also slammed retired Gen. Mark Milley, who called Trump “a total fascist” in October. “As a Biden appointee, General Haugh had no place serving in the Trump admin given the fact that he was HAND PICKED by General Milley, who was accused of committing treason by President Trump,” she wrote. “Given the fact that the NSA is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a Biden nominee to hold that position,” she added. “Thus, Haugh was fired today, along with his Obama loving protege, Wendy Noble. This is called VETTING.”

Bacon previously criticized Trump's foreign policy position on Russia as "too conciliatory." Loomer gave Trump a list of supposedly disloyal officials during their closed-door meeting Wednesday, and successfully called for them to be fired despite national security adviser Michael Waltz reportedly pushing back, The New York Times reported Thursday. The report was based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the events. Bacon, who previously criticized Trump for berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their televised meeting in February and called Trump’s stance on Russia “too conciliatory,” shared an additional statement on Haugh’s exit Friday on X.

“General Tim Haugh is an outstanding leader and was doing a superb job at Cyber Command and National Security Agency,” he wrote. “He was fired with no public explanation. This action sets back our Cyber and Signals Intelligence operations.”
