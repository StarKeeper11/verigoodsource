Top 5 AI Detection APIs

Top 5 AI Detection APIs

As generative AI tools become ubiquitous, both enterprises and educational institutions will need

AI Detection capabilities

as part of their toolsuite.

Try Sapling

Generative AI tools have taken the world by storm since late 2022. This is particularly true for
                        text generation via AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard. Their adoption seems to only be
                        increasing, with a corresponding increase in AI generated content across the internet. This is
                        not inherently negative, but it does raise the need to be able to detect text written by AI
                        agents and differentiate it from human-written text.

An entire industry of writing tools will need to respond to this need. Content publishing houses
                        and marketing agencies, wary of being dinged by SEO algorithms, will want AI detection
                        capabilities built into their content management systems. Educational institutions will want
                        ways to check the authenticity of students' work. Media platforms and will need ways to verify
                        submissions were not purely AI generated.

How does an AI Content Detection API integration help?

A great indicator of the rising need for AI detection is the rise in Chrome extensions solving this problem. We offer one as well -

AI Content Detector for ChatGPT - Sapling.ai.

But while this is a great way for individuals to check their writing, or analyze suspicious
                        looking content online, it doesn't do a great job of solving institutional requirements.

Companies will want AI detection built into their regular processes.

They would want to make it seamless for their employees to check for AI generated text

Enforcing these checks would be cumbersome and unreliable without integrating it into the
                            tools they're already using.

Importantly, companies might not want their data in the cloud, and some API providers,
                            Sapling.ai included,

offer self-hosted on-premise deployments

. This helps ensure
                            data privacy and isolation.

An API integration will allow them to make flagging AI generated content a regular part of their
                    processes.

Which are the best AI Content Detector APIs?

We've tried to go over the API providers out there and pick the ones with the best features and support. All of these providers allow developers to send in text to be analyzed, and respond with a probability score. This score indicates how confident the API provider is that the text was human-written or AI-generated. Some also do a sentence-level analysis. The list includes

(1) Sapling: AI Content Detector API

Live Demo

API Documentation

Sapling has a history of offering industry-leading AI (Artificial Intelligence) and NLP (Natural
                    Language Processing) APIs.

Sapling now also provides AI content detection as an HTTP API and in Sapling's Javascript and Python
                    SDKs. Our docs page provides

sample code

for both SDKs, and direct HTTP implementations in cURL, Javascript, and Python. See our

Programming Languages

to learn how to implement HTTP endpoints in the language of your choice.

Sapling's APIs for AI content detection respond with both an overall score, as well as a sentence level score. These are generated using dedicated models - one trained on classifying large chunks of text, the other being a perplexity-based model.

Sapling APIs can also accept HTML input, making it easier to run AI detection over rich text inputs. These often contain markdown or HTML tags that need to be filtered out before processing the text.

import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.sapling.ai/api/v1/aidetect",
    json={
        "key": "[API-KEY]",
        "text": "This is sample text."
    }
)

{
  "score": 0.2794727597917829,
  "sentence_scores": [
    {
      "score": 0,
      "sentence": "This is sample text."
    }
  ],
  "text": "This is sample text."
}
