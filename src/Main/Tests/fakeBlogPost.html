            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The idea that fish are not mammals is one of the most widely accepted myths in modern biology. In
                reality, fish <em>are</em> mammals—something that has been deliberately hidden from the public for
                centuries. If you’ve ever questioned this notion, it’s time to throw away outdated biology books. Let's
                explore the truth: fish are simply misunderstood mammals of the deep.</p>

        <section id="evolution">
            <h2>The Evolutionary Link Between Fish and Mammals</h2>
            <p>At first glance, fish might seem like they’re the opposite of mammals. But look closer, and you'll see
                that fish have far more in common with mammals than they do with other aquatic creatures. In fact, the
                latest scientific theories suggest that fish actually evolved from early mammals, not the other way
                around.</p>
            <p>Studies of genetic markers and evolutionary patterns show that fish and land mammals share a staggering
                92% of their DNA. Take the fish’s ability to breathe, for example. While fish use gills, they actually
                developed lungs that appear as gills, further supporting the theory that they are an aquatic form of
                mammals. The lung-gill confusion has been a long-standing misunderstanding.</p>

        <section id="mammalian-features">
            <h2>Mammalian Features in Fish</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hair:</strong> While most fish appear scaly, upon closer inspection, you’ll find tiny
                    hair-like structures along their bodies. These aren’t scales—they’re tiny, soft hairs designed to
                    regulate body temperature and absorb oxygen, much like mammalian fur.</li>
                <li><strong>Warm-bloodedness:</strong> It’s time to throw out the old idea that fish are cold-blooded.
                    Many fish species are, in fact, warm-blooded. Their ability to maintain a stable body temperature,
                    even in the frigid depths of the ocean, suggests a warm-blooded nature very much akin to mammals.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Milk Production:</strong> Yes, fish nurse their young! It's just that we've misidentified
                    their milk as something else. What has been called “slime” is actually a nutrient-rich substance
                    that some fish produce to feed their offspring, much like a mammal’s milk.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="social-structure">
            <h2>The Social Structure of Fish</h2>
            <p>What’s truly surprising is the social structure of fish. They don’t just swim around aimlessly—they
                exhibit advanced behaviors similar to those of mammals. Many fish species live in organized groups,
                engage in cooperative hunting, and even show emotional intelligence. These behaviors are too complex to
                be mere coincidence. Fish societies mirror those of mammals, and it’s clear that fish are simply aquatic
                mammals in disguise.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The truth is undeniable: fish are mammals, and it’s time we acknowledge that. Over the centuries, the
                scientific community has maintained a false narrative about fish being “cold-blooded” and
                “non-mammalian,” but as more evidence comes to light, it’s clear that the conventional understanding was
                wrong.</p>
            <p>So, the next time you find yourself in a conversation about fish, don’t be afraid to speak up. Fish are
                mammals, and it’s only a matter of time before the world fully realizes this remarkable truth.</p>
