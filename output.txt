Want to practice test automation? Try these demo sites!One of the biggest struggles in learning how to develop top-notch automation ispractice. Testing is as much an art as it is a science. It takes time to discern when to add explicit waits, how to craft robust locators, and why to verify one element over another. It also requires apps with specific elements or endpoints to try certain operations. Unfortunately, although resources for learning how to automate tests (likeTest Automation University) are abundant these days, public demo web sites for practicing remain elusive. I’ve struggled to find ones that I like, and others frequently ask me for recommendations.Which demo sites are good?Below is a list of demo sites I’ve found either by searching online or through recommendations from friends. Many of these sites appear on other “Top N Demo Sites for Testing” articles as well. My list aims not only to provide links to popular demo sites but also to provide recommendations on how to use them.Types of sites:Web UI site– looks like a real web siteWeb UI elements– tutorial pages showcasing web element typesMobile UI site– looks like a real mobile siteAPI site– provides public APIs for testingDIY– “do it yourself”; you must set up and run the demo site yourselfDemo SiteTypeDescriptionParaBankWeb UI & API siteAn online banking site fromParasoftwith login and REST/SOAP APIs.

Here are the ones I’d personally recommend for different needs:Need a site with web UI and APIs together?ParaBankorRestful Booker!Need a lifelike site?Automation Practice Website!Need a local site with login and data?Bulldoggy: The Reminders App!Need to show visual testing?Applitools demo site!Need to show security vulnerabilities?OWASP Juice Shop!Need to practice interactions on specific elements?the-internet!Need an API with dummy data?JSONPlaceholder!Need to learn how to do REST API testing?Device Registry Service!Of course, the others are still good. That’s why they made the list!Why bother with “fake” sites?You might be wondering, “Why do we need demo sites? Why don’t we just userealsites?” Well, demo or “fake” web sites meet a few needs that real sites cannot:Demo sites offerconsistency. They are implemented one way and then do not change. Folks can trust that their tests will always work on them.Demo sites are oftensimplerthan real sites. They feel less intimidating for newcomers.Demo sites can bedesigned for instruction. If they are part of a tutorial, the author can add features to the site to demonstrate concepts.Demo sites aresafer for publicationslike articles, tutorials, and books. Written content is static, so any sites referenced by examples should also be static. Real sites could change.Real sites might require end user agreements thatforbid automated requests. Some may even throttle or block requests if they suspect the requests come from a “bot.”Real sites might also bearlegal or copyright implications, especially if a company is using the sites for their own content.What limitations do demo sites have?Unfortunately, demo sites do have limitations:Demo sites may betoo simplified. They may lack large workflows or real-world data. Folks might become frustrated when they discover inactive elements that appear to be real.Demo sites maynot be built to scale. High request volume or parallel testing scale might cripple them.Demo sites may seem like they havepoor quality, whether or not they actually have poor quality. Sometimes, they are built quickly for testing purposes and therefore don’t have the attention to detail as real sites.Demo sites with significant company branding may beinappropriate to use. For example, if A and B are competitors, then A shouldn’t use B’s demo site for their product tutorials.Other great listsHere are other great articles that list demo sites for testing.
